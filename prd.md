## Product Requirements Document (PRD)

### 1. Introduction

This Product Requirements Document outlines the development of a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) application for generating custom images using Fal models. It incorporates the key objectives, architectural decisions, feature specifications, and user requirements based on the feedback gathered.

### 2. Product Overview

**2.1 Purpose**

The service will let users create AI-generated images by submitting text prompts and configuring advanced parameters. The platform will offer multiple Fal models and permanently store user-generated images for re-download and sharing.

**2.2 Business Objectives**

- Monetize via a subscription model with usage quotas and no overage charges.
- Offer a free tier to encourage adoption and user trials.
- Provide intuitive workflows for prompt-based image generation, advanced customizations, and progress updates.

### 3. Target Users & Market

- Creative hobbyists looking for inspiration or quick visuals.
- Small businesses or freelancers needing AI-driven imagery for design or marketing.
- Technology enthusiasts experimenting with AI-driven art.

### 4. Key Features

**4.1 Subscription Tiers & Quota Management**

- **Free Tier**: 100 image generations per month. No overage charges; generation stops when quota is depleted.
- **Paid Tiers**: Various monthly plans (e.g., 300, 500, or 1,000 images). Usage credits renew monthly, and no generation is allowed beyond the quota.

**4.2 Image Generation with Fal Models**

- **Models Offered**:
    - `rundiffusion-fal/rundiffusion-photo-flux`
    - `fal-ai/flux-pro/v1.1-ultra`
    - `rundiffusion-fal/juggernaut-flux/pro`
    - `rundiffusion-fal/juggernaut-flux/lightning`
- Real-time or near-real-time updates on generation progress, if supported by Fal or otherwise simulated through polling.
- Advanced Parameter Support: style selection, resolution, negative prompts.

**4.3 Permanent Image Storage & Sharing**

- Generated images are stored long-term in object storage (e.g., AWS S3).
- Users can view their library of generated images, download them, or share via short links.

**4.4 User Interface & Experience**

- A more complex interface that shows real-time or near-real-time progress indicators.
- Parameter sliders and fields for advanced settings.
- A gallery or dashboard page listing previously generated images with direct actions (download, share link).

**4.5 Logging & Analytics**

- Track user prompts, generation parameters, and usage patterns for future analytics and performance tuning.
- No immediate compliance or GDPR considerations, but built with potential future privacy needs in mind.

### 5. Product Requirements

**5.1 Functional Requirements**

1. **User Authentication & Registration**
    - The system must allow account creation via email and password (or social login if desired).
    - The system must maintain user session security and handle password resets.
2. **Subscription Management**
    - The system must support at least one free and one paid tier.
    - The system must integrate with a payment provider (e.g., Stripe) for monthly subscription billing.
    - The system must reset usage credits on monthly renewal dates.
    - The system must enforce subscription limits (disable generation once limit is reached).
3. **Image Generation**
    - The system must integrate with Fal’s image generation capabilities.
    - The system must allow users to input text prompts and select from four available Fal models.
    - The system must support advanced parameters (e.g., negative prompts, resolution).
    - The system must decrement the user’s remaining credits upon successful generation of an image.
4. **Image Storage & Retrieval**
    - The system must store generated images permanently in a secure storage solution.
    - The system must enable users to view, download, and share generated images.
    - The system must maintain metadata (prompt, model used, timestamp, etc.) for each image.
5. **Usage Dashboard**
    - The system must display information about the user’s subscription plan and how many credits remain in the current billing cycle.
    - The system must visually show the user that they have exceeded their quota (if that occurs) and prompt them to upgrade or wait until renewal.

**5.2 Non-Functional Requirements**

1. **Performance**
    - The system should return generated images within an acceptable timeframe (varies by model but typically within seconds to a minute).
    - The system should efficiently scale up or down if usage spikes, although high concurrency is not an immediate concern for the MVP.
2. **Security**
    - All user data and prompts must be transmitted over HTTPS.
    - Authentication tokens or session cookies must be kept secure.
    - The system should have basic rate limiting to prevent brute force attacks and generation abuse.
3. **Reliability & Logging**
    - The system should log generation requests, errors, and successful completions.
    - Logs should be retained for internal analytics and debugging.

### 6. User Workflows

**6.1 Onboarding / Registration**

- User visits the site and signs up for a free plan or a paid subscription.
- If paid, user completes payment flow; credits are set accordingly.

**6.2 Generating an Image**

- User navigates to “Generate” page in the dashboard.
- User enters text prompt, chooses a model, configures advanced parameters, and clicks “Generate.”
- System validates user’s remaining credits and calls the Fal model endpoint.
- Upon success, a preview of the newly generated image appears and is stored automatically.

**6.3 Viewing & Sharing Past Images**

- User opens the “Gallery” or “My Images” page.
- User sees a list/grid of previously generated images.
- The user can download them or share them using public links.

**6.4 Subscription Renewal & Limit Enforcement**

- Quotas renew monthly.
- Users on free or paid plans lose the ability to generate images once their credits are depleted; the system shows an upgrade or waiting message.

### 7. Technical Design & Implementation

**7.1 Front End**

- Next.js or a React-based framework deployed on Vercel.
- Pages: Landing, Dashboard, Generate, Gallery, Subscription Management.
- Payment integration views (Stripe Checkout or custom flow).

**7.2 Back End & API**

- Vercel Serverless Functions for the following routes:
    - `/api/register`, `/api/login`
    - `/api/subscribe` (initiates or confirms payment)
    - `/api/generate` (calls Fal to create images)
    - `/api/images` (CRUD operations for user-generated images)

**7.3 Fal Provider Integration**

- Use `experimental_generateImage` (from `@ai-sdk/fal` or `ai`) with the four specified models.
- Incorporate advanced parameter passing as supported by the Fal model.

**7.4 Database & Object Storage**

- Database: PostgreSQL or MySQL for user accounts, subscription info, and references to images.
- Object Storage (e.g., AWS S3) for permanent storage of generated images.
- Link images in the DB to their corresponding storage paths or URLs.

### 8. Milestones & Roadmap

- **MVP Launch (4–8 weeks estimated)**:
    1. User authentication & subscription setup (basic free + single paid tier).
    2. Basic Fal model integration and prompt-based image generation.
    3. Permanent image storage and gallery.
    4. Usage credit tracking and monthly resets.
- **Future Enhancements (Post-MVP)**:
    1. Additional payment plans.
    2. More sophisticated analytics dashboard.
    3. Model usage stats and advanced performance tuning.
    4. Consideration for data privacy regulations (GDPR, etc.).

### 9. Risks & Assumptions

- **Risk**: Fal model speed or reliability may vary, potentially frustrating users.
    - **Mitigation**: Provide sensible timeouts and fallback.
- **Risk**: Subscription management errors leading to customer dissatisfaction.
    - **Mitigation**: Thorough testing of payment and billing cycles.
- **Assumption**: Minimal concurrency or scaling concerns for MVP, but may need to revisit if the user base grows rapidly.

### 10. Acceptance Criteria

- Users can register, log in, and manage subscriptions.
- Users on the free plan can generate up to 100 images/month.
- Paid plan users have a higher monthly quota and no generation possible after exceeding it (until renewal).
- Four Fal models are available, each allowing advanced prompts and parameters.
- Generated images are stored permanently and accessible via the user’s gallery.
- The system logs generation events for future analysis.

### 11. Open Questions / Next Steps

- Confirm if there are any design constraints around real-time progress streaming. If Fal does not support streaming, consider implementing a polling mechanism for progress.
- Determine whether or not an admin dashboard is needed right away (e.g., to manually adjust user subscriptions, reset credits, or view logs).
- Decide how to evolve the product for potential data-privacy compliance in the future if the user base expands beyond a small development group.

This PRD provides a structured outline of the requirements and implementation strategy for quickly delivering an MVP and expanding features over time as the product matures.
