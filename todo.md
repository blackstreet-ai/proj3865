### Implementation Steps (To-Do List)

1. **Initialize Project Structure**
    - Create a new repository.
    - Set up a Next.js project on Vercel.
    - Configure environment variables for local development (database URL, Fal keys, etc.).
2. **Set Up User Authentication System**
    - Implement routes for **`/api/register`** and **`/api/login`**.
    - Use secure password hashing (e.g., bcrypt).
    - Integrate session management or JWT tokens.
3. **Implement Subscription Management**
    - Integrate Stripe (or another payment platform) for subscription and billing.
    - Create subscription tiers in Stripe (free and paid tiers).
    - Implement logic to assign a user’s subscription plan during registration or upgrade.
    - Build webhook endpoint to handle Stripe renewal events and reset credits accordingly.
4. **Create Database Schema**
    - Define tables for Users, Subscriptions, and Images.
    - Include fields for user details (email, password hash), subscription plan info, usage credits, and renewal dates.
    - Include fields for image references (prompt, model used, S3 path, timestamp).
5. **Integrate Fal Image Generation**
    - Set up the **`/api/generate`** route.
    - Use the Fal Provider’s **`experimental_generateImage`** with the four specified models.
    - Implement logic for advanced parameters (negative prompts, resolution, etc.).
    - Decrement usage credits upon successful generation.
6. **Implement Image Storage**
    - Configure AWS S3 (or another object storage) with secure credentials.
    - Update **`/api/generate`** to upload generated images to S3 after retrieval.
    - Store the image URL and metadata in the database.
7. **Build Front End Pages**
    - **Landing Page**: Explains the service, highlights pricing tiers, offers sign-up.
    - **Dashboard**: Shows subscription status, remaining credits, upgrade options.
    - **Generate Page**: Allows prompt input, model selection, and parameter adjustment.
    - **Gallery**: Displays previously generated images, with links for download or sharing.
8. **Add Usage Credit Checks & Quota Enforcement**
    - Implement middleware or checks in **`/api/generate`** that compare the user’s remaining credits vs. usage.
    - Disable generation if quota is depleted, providing an appropriate error response to the front end.
9. **Implement Logging & Analytics (Basic)**
    - Store relevant logs in the database or a logging service (prompt, timestamp, user ID, generation time).
    - Optionally implement a simple admin view or logs table to review usage patterns.
10. **Conduct Testing & Refinement**
    - Test user flows: registration, billing, image generation with different Fal models.
    - Verify usage credits reset on subscription renewal (via Stripe webhook).
    - Ensure error handling is properly displayed in the UI (e.g., no credits left).
11. **Deploy & Iterate**
    - Deploy MVP to Vercel.
    - Test in production (test mode for Stripe).
    - Gather user feedback, fix bugs, and refine features.
    - Plan for future enhancements (new subscription tiers, advanced analytics, admin dashboard, etc.).

These steps provide a high-level to-do list for building and launching the MVP of the image generation SaaS. They align with the functional and non-functional requirements specified in this PRD without assigning any specific deadlines.
